# Brain Tuner stats from iTunes Connect in 2008

This folder contains file(s) relating to the original Brain Tuner release in 2008.

The `.numbers` package is actually a Numbers spreadsheet file which can be opened in Apple's Numbers app.

In August 2008, Brain Tuner was #2 on Apple's list of Top Free Apps, and the ensuing download counts can be found here.

Big thanks to @bridger for making this happen back in the day! Not only did he provide this spreadsheet, but he helped me a lot in getting started, getting provisioning profiles sorted out, and publishing my first app (this one!)
